                        <strong>If you have been paying for cable this century you have been getting ripped off by greedy cable companies.</strong>

                        by year 2020. However, the average salary and fixed income for seniors remains the same.</p>

                    <p>This trick was introduced to me by my neighbour who is a renowned engineer from Japan. He&rsquo;s always
                        travelling and uses this trick to get free HD Shows/Movies wherever he goes. </p>
                    <p>One day while we were collecting our mail, I complained to him about my cable bill. That&rsquo;s when
                        he laughed at me and told me about his Home Amping trick. </p>
                    <p>He said
                        <strong>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t paid a cable bill in over 10 years.&rdquo;</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>I replied &ldquo;How are you watching TV!? Are you using one of those digital antennas?&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;There is no such thing as a &lsquo;digital&rsquo; antenna.
                        An antenna is an antenna. It will pick up any signal that is broadcast.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Then he explained that according to law, every TV station has to broadcast the same signal out over the
                        air -
                        <strong>100% FOR FREE!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>He said that cable companies have been &ldquo;scrambling&rdquo; their channels to force the general public,
                        like you, to pay for their expensive monthly service.
                        <strong>They made you believe that there are no other options.</strong> However, that changed in early 2019
                        when the U.S. Government passed a new bill stating that TV Signals are now legally public property
                        and
                        <strong>&ldquo;belong to the people&rdquo;</strong>. &mdash; Do you agree?</p>

                        Eric Foster, a Comcast shareholder, was definitely not amused when this bill passed.
                    </h6>
                    <p>&ldquo;Think about it. There are thousands of feet of electrical wiring built in your house or apartment
                        building. And what is an antenna? Just a long wire!</p>
                    <p>You already have the greatest antenna ever made built into you house. It&rsquo;s like a personalized
                        SpaceX satellite dish to receive television!&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>He told me about the astonishing LiveWave device that taps into the raw power of your home wiring. By
                        doing this, you amplify your home to effortlessly catches low frequency electromagnetic waves at
                        any distance. </p>
                    <p>LiveWave is super simple to use. Plug it into any electrical outlet and it instantly changes your house
                        wires into a giant super antenna that can grab hundreds of HD shows/movies.</p>
                    <p>Yet it never interferes with your electrical system and it is impossible to have any kind of shock hazard.
                        It also cost nothing to operate.</p>
                    <blockquote>“This revolutionary antenna is 200% better than cable. You’ll be able to watch your favorite TV shows,
                        movies, and sports. You will never have to deal with your horrible cable service provider again.
                        It’s truly a remarkable breakthrough.”</blockquote>

                        <strong>Experts Call This New Technology The Biggest Breakthrough In Modern Science...</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>Since our initial research, this revolutionary invention has been quickly gaining traction around the
                        world. The device has been patented and sold to a major Silicon Valley Fund to further test and improve
                        the technology. The company and product is now called
                        <a href="https://trk.carbonclean.tech/click" class="offer-link">LiveWave</a>.</p>
                    <p>According to their site, the antenna contains a very unique technology that further unlocks low frequency
                        signals making it available on your TV. There are rumors that some celebrities are already using
                        their LiveWave Antennas prior to a full market release later this year.</p>
                    <p>Our resident engineer, Dr. Farhan Raqif, conducted his own independent analysis of the antenna and his
                        findings seemed to mirror LiveWave&rsquo;s claims.</p>

                                "After 7 days, I wrote my last $140.00 check to the cable company, put it in the mail and cancelled my service. It was an
                                amazing feeling to never having to worry about another bill to pay on time. All in all, I
                                was able to access hundreds of shows/movies in 1080 HD. It&rsquo;s like getting free cable
                                or satellite TV."

                            a little bit unbelievable to be honest. I need to order these for my mom before they are released

                            a splash. Our resources from CNET.com informed us that big cable companies are trying to put
                            a stop to the release of this product.</p>
