            <blockquote>"If you could stop paying for cable or satellite TV and still get all of your favorite TV channels in HD for FREE, would you do it?" â€“ Asaka Takegi Ph.D."</blockquote>
            <div class="articleText">
                <p>Recently in an interview, the renowned Nobel Prize laureate and Ph.D. engineer Asaka Takegi hinted at an upcoming advancement in TV broadcast, which would replace the all-digital signals (DTV) system that has been in place since 2009 with groundbreaking over-the-air technology. </p>
                <p>Asaka Takegi commented in an interview that American cable companies have historically always been able to prevent viewers from accessing channels for free by scrambling them. 2019 is the year this all changed, because the government determined that TV signals were not private property and belonged to the general public. </p>
                <p>This ruling caused a wave of panic among major cable companies, since people can now watch any HD channel they want without needing to pay for satellite or cable TV services. Free access to all HD, international and premium channels is now possible through the <strong><a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna</a></strong> if public broadcast is available in your locality, and the best part is, itâ€™s all legal now. </p>
                <div class="articleImg">
                    <center><img src="img/bow.jpg" width="100%" /></center>
                </div>
                <p>It took five years of work to develop a super antenna, but Japanese scientists were able to break through with this innovation in the television market that will let you watch as many as local HD channels and record DVR â€“ all for free. </p>
                <p>Top engineers were invited by the University of Tokyo more than ten years ago, to collaborate and invent a tool to intercept low frequency electromagnetic waves from afar. </p>
                <p>Their hard work bore fruit five years later, when they finally came up with military grade equipment that was a leap forward for science. </p>
                <p>Their invention is undoubtedly the most capable of detecting electromagnetic signals such as television frequencies in high resolutions. </p>
                <p>Multiple tests of this technology revealed astonishing results. As one test subject said:</p>

                <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size:18px;">"At first I didn&#39;t not believe that such technology existed. But I was astound when I turned on my TV and received a clear picture with lots of channels.â€ - Peter Anderson</blockquote>

                <div class="articleImg">
                    <center><img src="img/tv.jpg" width="100%" /></center>
                </div>

                <p>Dr. Takahashi, the engineer leading this team, had some worthy insights to share about the technology which went into this innovative antenna: </p>
                <blockquote style="font-size:18px;">
                    "It is engineered and tested by top military engineers that makes no failure option to ensure quality of image and quantity of more channels that regular cable company provides, while serving you at <strong>no monthly cost for the service.</strong>
                    <p>We are all very grateful to have this now, as I believe it can help everyone on the planet and take us to the <strong>next stage of advancements in television</strong>. Weâ€™re very proud."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>An associate of his, Dr. Hirotoshi Sato Ph.D., had this to add:</p>
                <blockquote style="font-size:18px;">"This revolutionary Antenna enables your TV to be the most efficient it can. With abundance of channels, it provides you with the ability to record your favorite shows on DVR. Access premium sport, news and movie channels and you will never have to deal with horrible cable company customer service. Its truly a remarkable breakthrough."
                </blockquote>

            </div>
            <div class="articleSubheader">So does this invention actually make a difference?</div>
            <div class="articleText">
                <p>Can this Antenna really change the lives of ordinary TV viewers? </p>
                <p>We can only find out by trying it, and thanks to the new cable ruling in 2019, a Silicon Valley Fund was able to purchase the rights to it for a limited time of 3 months from the University of Tokyo, who owns the patent. </p>
                <p>Most of us would agree that saving money is a top priority. Iâ€™d absolutely go for something that eliminates the $168 I spend each month on cable bills and actually has more to offer than the paid service. </p>
                <p>It isnâ€™t every day that you get the chance to significantly increase channel access so easily. With one click, you can do away with cable costs and will never have to deal with bad customer service again. You can replace all that with free access to all of your favorite channels, from any location. </p>
                <p>Warren Buffett very aptly said: "Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving".</p>
                <p>So do you feel itâ€™s about time you get rid of cable bills, increase your savings and step into the future of TV with one smart decision? </p>

                <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size:18px;">"I wouldnâ€™t have developed this patented equipment if not for my incredible and supportive family and humble beginnings that drove me to realize the importance of saving money.â€ - DR. HIROTOSHI SATO
                </blockquote>
                <p>So do you think this piece of futuristic technology is for you? Our super antenna will be arriving any time, and we will share our findings with you soon. We recommend that you order yours before itâ€™s too late! </p>
                <p>Seeing is believing, so donâ€™t miss this opportunity to check it out. This could end up saving you thousands of dollars in the long run. Donâ€™t forget to let us know about your experience once youâ€™ve tried it.</p>

                <p>Some of the richest people in the country have professed to use the <a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna</a> for viewing ten times more channels on their TV than before. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="articleSubheader">We decided to see for ourselves whether it was actually the real deal. </div>
            <div class="articleText">
                <p>Since we were getting such positive feedback from everywhere, we had to verify all these claims by trying out the LiveWave Antenna. It was decided that William Peterson would be the lucky volunteer who gets to test it. Here is how it went for him after using the <a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna </a>for a week: </p>

            </div>

                <p>We have known Peterson for years. "<a href="#">The LiveWave HDTV Antenna</a> was extremely hard to come by" says Peterson. He also advised, "If you can get your hands on this Antenna - get them right away." It was two weeks before we were able to buy one for testing because of the high demand, and it was going for more than $300 on eBay as sellers were trying to make the most out of the opportunity. Buyers were willing to pay high prices for this technology. </p>
                <p>We were pleasantly surprised by the fast shipping as the <a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna </a>arrived in a few days. So here is what William Peterson experienced in seven days of using the <a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna</a>: </p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"The antenna is supposed to work flawlessly in both the city and the country side, but for our purposes, I drove out to my country side residence to conduct my test...Setup was fast and easy. I simply plugged it in to the TV and stuck the antenna to the window (you don't have to stick it to the window, you can stick it anywhere you want). What happened next was astonishingâ€¦ I turned the TV on and found myself staring back at an incredibly clear channel in HD. I endlessly kept flipping through channels and to my amazement, every channel was crystal clear. Best of all, I received more popular channels than I would get with cable."</p>

It was as if I was getting free cable or satellite TV."</p>

I need to order a few of these before they are released into stores." - William Peterson</blockquote>
                <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size:18px;">"The results were unbelievable. I was receiving so much more for a "joke" one time price. A must have" - Sandy Axelrod from Florida.
                </blockquote>
                <p>The <a href="#">LiveWave HDTV Antenna</a> is expected to be fully released in markets sometime in late 2019, and thereâ€™s no doubt it will come with a bang.
